# Python--Blockchain
This project involves creating a basic blockchain and understanding the working of BlockChain Technology. The code creates a simple blockchain with two blocks – Genesis and the next.

3 components involved in running the Block Chain Technology are
Clients – Who make the transactions
Miner – Who collects the transactions, validates them and mines a block
Block – which contains the transaction details
Blockchain is a data structure that chains all the mined blocks in chronological order. This chain is immutable and thus tamper-proof.
